## Purpose of This Document

Cybersecurity and ethical hacking are **broad fields**, not single job roles.

Many beginners enter this domain knowing _how to learn_, but not **where they fit**. This document exists to:

- Clarify real-world cybersecurity job roles
    
- Explain what each role actually does
    
- Show how ethical hacking skills map to careers
    
- Help beginners identify areas of interest early
    

This is a **reference and orientation file**, not a certification guide.

## Ethical Hacking vs Cybersecurity Roles

Before listing roles, it is important to understand the distinction:

- **Ethical Hacking** focuses on _offensive security_ (finding weaknesses)
    
- **Cybersecurity** includes offensive, defensive, governance, and monitoring roles
    

Most professionals specialize over time, but early careers often overlap.
