## What is Ethical Hacking?

Hacking refers to unauthorized access of systems, be it read , modify or delete. Ethical hacking is the authorized testing of hacking real world systems.
**Ethical hacking** is the authorized practice of identifying, analyzing, and responsibly reporting security weaknesses in systems, networks, applications, and infrastructures.

The goal is **not to break systems for personal gain**, but to:

- Understand how real attackers think and operate
    
- Discover weaknesses _before_ malicious actors do
    
- Help organizations improve their security posture
    

Ethical hacking is performed **with permission**, **within legal boundaries**, and **with clear scope and responsibility**.

## Why Ethical Hacking Exists

Modern systems are complex. No software, network, or organization is perfectly secure.

Ethical hacking exists because:

- Defensive security alone is insufficient
    
- Real attackers constantly evolve
    
- Security must be tested under real-world conditions
    

Ethical hackers simulate real attacks to **measure actual risk**, not theoretical safety.

## The CIA Triad – Foundation of Information Security

All cybersecurity concepts ultimately revolve around the **CIA Triad**, which defines what security is meant to protect.

### 1. Confidentiality

- Ensuring information is accessible **only to authorized entities**
    
- Examples: encryption, access controls, authentication
    

### 2. Integrity

- Ensuring data is **accurate and unaltered**
    
- Examples: hashing, digital signatures, checksums
    

### 3. Availability

- Ensuring systems and data are **accessible when needed**
    
- Examples: redundancy, backups, DDoS protection
    

> If a system fails at **any one** of these three, security is compromised.

## The DAD Triad – Attacker’s Perspective

From an attacker’s viewpoint, security is broken by violating CIA. This is expressed as the **DAD Triad**.

### 1. Disclosure

- Exposing confidential information
    
- Examples: data breaches, leaks, unauthorized access
    

### 2. Alteration

- Modifying data or system behavior
    
- Examples: defacement, tampering, privilege abuse
    

### 3. Denial

- Preventing legitimate access to systems or services
    
- Examples: DoS/DDoS attacks, resource exhaustion
    

> Ethical hackers think in **CIA**, but attack in **DAD**.

## Types of Hackers

Hackers are classified based on **intent, authorization, and legality**.

### 1. White Hat Hackers

- Authorized security professionals
    
- Work within legal and ethical boundaries
    
- Examples: penetration testers, security researchers
    

### 2. Black Hat Hackers

- Unauthorized and malicious actors
    
- Motivated by profit, power, or ideology
    
- Examples: cybercriminals, ransomware groups
    

### 3. Gray Hat Hackers

- Operate between white and black hats
    
- May break rules but not always for malicious intent
    
- Often controversial and legally risky
    

### 4. Script Kiddies

- Limited technical understanding
    
- Rely on pre-built tools and scripts
    

### 5. Hacktivists

- Politically or ideologically motivated
    
- Target organizations to promote causes

## Types of Ethical Hacking (Security Domains)

Ethical hacking is not a single activity. It spans multiple **domains**, each focusing on a different attack surface.

### 1. Web Application Hacking

- Targets websites, APIs, and web services
    
- Common issues:
    
    - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
        
    - SQL Injection
        
    - CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
        
    - Authentication and authorization flaws
        

### 2. Network Hacking

- Targets internal and external networks
    
- Focuses on:
    
    - Open ports and services
        
    - Misconfigurations
        
    - Network protocols
        

### 3. System / Server Hacking

- Targets operating systems and servers
    
- Includes:
    
    - Privilege escalation
        
    - Misconfigured services
        
    - Weak credentials
        

### 4. Wireless Hacking

- Targets Wi-Fi and wireless protocols
    
- Includes:
    
    - Weak encryption
        
    - Rogue access points
        
    - WPS vulnerabilities
        

### 5. Cloud Security Testing

- Targets cloud infrastructure and services
    
- Includes:
    
    - IAM misconfigurations
        
    - Exposed storage
        
    - Insecure APIs
        

### 6. Mobile Application Security

- Targets Android and iOS apps
    
- Includes:
    
    - Insecure storage
        
    - API abuse
        
    - Reverse engineering
        

### 7. Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering

- Focuses on understanding malicious software
    
- Includes:
    
    - Binary analysis
        
    - Debugging
        
    - Behavior analysis

## Ethical Hacking vs Cybersecurity

Ethical hacking is a **subset** of cybersecurity.

- **Cybersecurity** is broad (policy, defense, governance, monitoring)
    
- **Ethical hacking** is offensive and testing-oriented
    

Both are essential and complementary.

---

## Legal and Ethical Boundaries

Ethical hacking is defined as much by **what you do not do** as by what you do.

Key principles:

- Always have **explicit permission**
    
- Stay within **defined scope**
    
- Do not access unnecessary data
    
- Report findings responsibly
    

Without authorization, hacking is illegal — regardless of skill or intent.
