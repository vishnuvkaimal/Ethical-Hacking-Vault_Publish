## 1. CIA Triad (Core Security Model)

The foundational information security model.

- **Confidentiality** – Prevent unauthorized access to data
    
- **Integrity** – Prevent unauthorized modification of data
    
- **Availability** – Ensure systems and data are accessible when needed
    

**Used in**: Risk assessment, policy design, audits, exams

---

## 2. DAD Triad (Attacker Perspective)

Represents what attackers try to break in CIA.

- **Disclosure** – Exposing confidential data
    
- **Alteration** – Modifying data or systems
    
- **Denial** – Disrupting access (DoS, outages)
    

**Used in**: Threat modeling, red‑team thinking

---

## 3. AAA Security Model (Access Control)

Framework governing authentication and access enforcement.

- **Authentication** – Verifying identity
    
- **Authorization** – Granting permissions
    
- **Accounting (Auditing)** – Logging and tracking actions
    

**Used in**: IAM, network security, enterprise systems

---

## 4. STRIDE Threat Model (Microsoft)

Threat classification model for system and application design.

- **S**poofing – Identity impersonation
    
- **T**ampering – Data or code modification
    
- **R**epudiation – Denying actions
    
- **I**nformation Disclosure – Data leakage
    
- **D**enial of Service – Service disruption
    
- **E**levation of Privilege – Gaining higher access
    

**Used in**: Application security, threat modeling

---

## 5. MITRE ATT&CK Framework

Knowledge base of real‑world adversary behavior.

- **Tactics** – Why an attacker acts (goal)
    
- **Techniques** – How the attacker acts

- **Recover**
    

**Used in**: Enterprises, compliance, policy alignment

---

## 8. OWASP Top 10 (Web Application Risk Model)

List of the most critical web application security risks. As its updated from time to time, make sure to get basic knowledge on the TOP 10 always as a standard upskilling habit

- Injection
    
- Broken Authentication
    
- Sensitive Data Exposure
    
- Security Misconfiguration
    
- etc.

**Used in**: Threat intelligence, SOC analysis

---

## 10. Purdue Model (ICS / OT Security)

Layered architecture for industrial control systems.

- Levels 0–5 (Physical → Enterprise)
    

**Used in**: OT, SCADA, critical infrastructure security

---

## 11. Zero Trust Security Model

Security philosophy assuming no implicit trust.

- Verify explicitly
    
- Least privilege
    
- Assume breach
    

**Used in**: Modern enterprise and cloud security

---

## 12. ISO/IEC 27001 / 27002

## Summary (Why This File Matters)

This document represents:

- The **language of cybersecurity professionals**
    
- The frameworks referenced in **certifications, reports, and audits**
    
- A **non‑tool mental model** of security
     

> Anyone who understands these frameworks understands _how security actually works_.
